# Diagnosis and Authentication Process, Epidemiology for App Developers
## LFPH GAEN Symposium Breakout Session


## Presentation on Diagnosis and Authentication

*   Each nation/state has a different definition for diagnosis
*   European countries have a centralized authentication system
*   4 main challenges in public health regarding use of GAEN apps during the pandemic
    *   Perception of privacy
    *   Adoption of the app and mindshare
    *   Ability to deal with costs 
    *   Does GAEN even help at all/relevant to public health?
*   If you start taking an all-or-nothing approach → will become problematic
    *   Privacy in manual contact tracing is highly compromised (health info, insurance plan)
    *   We have no clear evidence that digital contact tracing works
        *   20% of Singapore population has a digital contact tracing app
        *   60% of the above population in Singapore uploaded their positive tests to the app
*   Epidemiologists are not as concerned with real-time diagnosis , more concerned with trends
*   A super spreader event is extremely hard to track and hard to understand
    *   It takes 4 days for symptoms to show
    *   Usually takes place at large gatherings
*   In terms of diagnosis and authentication, a centralized system would be the best
    *   However, it would be costly
    *   Lots of work to actually implement


## Q&A

*   How much does testing impact the exposure notification? 
    *   There’s been a backlog in Alaska and Arizona
    *   There are many different parties that can authenticate a test
    *   Doctor could log into the portal and give an authenticated diagnosis
    *   State/country could have the decision to authenticate the test
*   What is the best way to authenticate at-home testing?
    *   The best way would be to send to lab and receive accurate result
        *   Will be timely
    *   Might be able to use the same approach as determining counterfeit- medicine
    *   Want to make sure that there will not be any false positives/ fraud cases
    *   Doctor-authenticated notices: have a doctor provide the key
        *   A number was generated by the patient and doctor would verify the number
        *   Have a diagnosis key and QR code: the user and the central system will both share a code
    *   There is tension between testing labs and government regarding confidential information
    *   Need for a permission number to prevent false reporting
    *   Since the system is anonymous, it is hard to validate a false report
        *   A doctor would be known within the system and would help prevent false reports
    *   Would be helpful to detect abuse of false reporting
        *   See if certain keys have been reported multiple times
*   Who do app developers/creators need permission from in order to launch the pilot of an app?
    *   Need permission from the state level in order for the app to be used at universities
    *   Universities might want more data for research regarding contact tracing but the tradeoff would be privacy issues that arise using G
    *   AEN app
