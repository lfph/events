# Adoption, Notification and User Experience

## LFPH GAEN Symposium Breakout Session


### Presenter on how to increase app adoption



*   Advertise and market app as a desirable product
*   Market towards many different groups of adopters, and address all concerns
    *   May be swayed by benefits of app, privacy, trust of official provider, tech aspects (battery life, accuracy)
*   Making a successful media campaign will take as much effort and work as actually launching the app did. 
*   Need brand campaigns, product marketing, and public relations aspects
    *   Implementers should consider how they can support and encourage public education campaigns run by the PHA. 
*   Word of mouth is a very big deal for app adoption and the design of the app itself can do things to influence how this goes. 


### Case study: Germany



*   In Germany, there are frequent (but not too prevalent) billboards advertising the app. It appears that the allocated budget was not meant to run for a long period of time. They wanted to give the organic adoption a little push at the beginning of the launch.
*   There is also less mask usage (and that kind of precautions) day to day there. Workers in shops do not wear masks. One-on-one interactions still include physicality. (This behaviour changed in the last few weeks, since infection rates are down and restrictions by law get lower and lower)
*   Most people there have heard of the app, but some do not have it installed for various reasons: 
    *   it was decided to only launch in the German app store. So many immigrants and visitors can’t access it. 
    *   There is not necessarily a sense of urgency
    *   old devices
    *   state surveillance concerns
*   There is a conservative element in Germany where (many) people play by the rules. They had a disciplined and successful reopening. When necessary, mini lock-downs occur in certain areas. This has been working in the app’s favor.
*   App just scans for exposures, shows risk (but is not very transparent). App is very basic, more passive. You have to take the steps to contact health authorities if you get an exposure alert.
*   What is the general communication strategy?
    *   Anecdotal: Media coverage around release date, outside advertisement, then it slowed down relatively quickly. Adoption numbers surged at the beginning but are no longer climbing
*   Metrics around where people were drawn into the app from?
    *   Driven by social awareness campaign, dealt with privacy concerns up front, focus on everyone doing their part
    *   Problem with some older phones not being able to use the app


### Uninstalls - How do people think about this with regards to adoption? 



*   That hasn’t been a concern up to this point, but we can’t tell who isn’t using the app vs uninstalls. In terms of metrics they look the same. 
*   There are complaints about bugs and we don’t know what the results of those complaints are. 
*   Elissa’s Five components of adoption: Initial download, bringing phone with you and turned on, willingness to upload diagnosis, willingness to comply with notifications, and keeping the app installed
    *   Too many or too little notifications can lead to uninstalls (people are annoyed or think the app isn’t working)
*   What info are we presenting to users to tell them what steps are important and what steps can more easily be dismissed?
    *   Delay in testing results and compliance around that - if your test results come a week or 14 days later, it’s hard to encourage compliance. 
    *   People need to know they should stay home after exposure even when they are not positive that they’re infected. 
    *   How would compliance look for marginalized communities?


### Brand



*   Curious to have a discussion about brand - how did / should teams consider branding a GAEN app from government vs from public health agency vs from a private brand. What tradeoffs to consider and what has been successful? (below are crowd-sourced responses)
    *   Apple requires covid apps to be submitted by the official health authority
    *   My advice would be to decide the branding in partnership with a good advertising agency.
    *   When developing our app we wanted to make sure that it was branded by the public health authority instead of the developers.  Apple also didn't give us the option going forward.
    *   Anecdotally, the German ads are labeled as “the government” — and in conversations, people are dismissive of that. Perhaps branded as coming from the PHA would have been more successful. Very hard for me to tell. This is where UX researchers trump anecdotes like mine.
    *   I know in the US, citizens are very wary of "the government"
    *   Some early research regarding most appealing providers to Americans, and on Switzerland as well, but I'm sure this will look different in various countries:

### Federation Concerns (much more discussion in the roaming and federation breakout)



*   Has anyone run into difficulties having different regions wanting to customize their apps?
    *   Ex. customizing attenuation, threshold by state/province
*   Looking at EU, there is a centralized approach and then letting each country run on their own. Even some individual states have gotten their own apps approved
    *   Some minimum customizations vs loose guidelines (like in Europe)
*   There are issues with an app not allowing addresses in other regions to register even though the app will still work. There are political issues with boundaries as well


### Public Health Interventions



*   Advertising is only a small part of public health intervention adoption -- perhaps we need a different set of tools
    *   This might look like changing the default (opt-out), linking it to other things, peer counselling/modelling
*   **We should not be looking at this as an app adoption, we should be looking at it as a public health intervention adoption**
*   Making something mandatory would lead to political backlash, so this is probably not possible if we want a positive reaction
*   How does the public see this? App or public health tool?
    *   This must be regionally adjusted
    *   Some argue we need to focus on traditional advertising because right now people need to choose individually to download
*   PR is very important, politicians speaking about how secure it is, using the app themselves, making sure there are segments on the local news. 
*   Public health interventions do not become the norm right away (think of seatbelts). How do we normalize this? How do we use our tech to help with this? How do we accelerate it?
    *   Numbers in the app can inform broader public health strategy
    *   Tech is just an arm of the public health adoption
*   We need to make sure that this is not the public health authorities telling us how to live. This should be bottom-up. Individuals should be self-empowered, not promoted by authorities


### Positive/Negative Incentives



*   Should employers require the use of an app?
*   We haven't seen forcing, but we have seen it being strongly encouraged
*   There is reluctance to having a new app specific to the workplace, people don’t want to have multiple apps. It would be preferable to have one gov app


### Key Takeaways and Final Comments



*   Best Practice: I believe the best practice should be one unified app for a whole country or region as opposed to separate apps for county, city, state, etc.  I believe national apps have a larger adoption rate than any smaller-entity apps would have.
*   The specifics of the technology are far less important, focusing awareness campaigns on how the privacy concerns have been addressed, why the application is useful and desirable, emphasize the social good.
*   I hope that UX Research & Studies about Adoption etc. are in the same way Open Source as the code
*   I think the completely anonymous, voluntary nature of an app will lead to greatest adoption. People will circumvent systems if they are forced.
*   I think the other area of focus - roaming/federation - is key  - let's be sure to consider how that impacts  ensuring adoption/notification is effective
*   Better understanding personal incentives/ features for downloading a contact tracing app, in addition to community incentives
*   Best Practice: Understand who you are building the app for and cater to their needs. Could be different for different aspects and markets
*   Best practice: I think people should have an incentive to use the app - contest/lotteries, news, local info (busy times for a shopping mall?) - anything to ensure people do not uninstall
    *   More research: roaming between countries (plenty of places in EU where people live in one country but work in a different one)
*   With regards to multiple apps vs single app... I'd say it's more critical that if there are going to be multiple apps (and there are) they need to work seamlessly together. so if I have an app installed from one source, it still seamlessly works with apps from other sources.
*   Any results from health depts. where they have reduced average work time per tracing contacts. Showing that contact that wouldn't have been found were found, which will help sway health depts. I think.
*   I encourage the app developer community to be as humble about their knowledge of adoption as public health professions should be about their knowledge of coding. They are separate disciplines. 
*   Best practice: Public health messages like these should come from (at least echoed by) local, trusted voices within a target community they can identify with - messages "from people who look like me". Key finding from the CDC's playbook on community engagement: [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/rr/rr6601a1.htm?s_cid=rr6601a1_w#B2_down](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/rr/rr6601a1.htm?s_cid=rr6601a1_w#B2_down)
*   Anonymity is important for adoption - small business (all businesses?) are afraid of stigma attached to exposure notification

A few things we found worked well for a previously released app:



*   One cohesive UX across platforms. Children will be explaining the app to parents/grandparents etc so consistent design on Android and iOS makes this easier. Will also increase speed of development, QA etc.
*   Reduce friction on onboarding, only ask what is absolutely necessary. Can it be asked at a later point?
*   You want to reach the widest audience so think about accessibility from the start. Colour contrast, tap areas, text scaling, etc all very important. 
*   Language support, design and build for multiple languages
